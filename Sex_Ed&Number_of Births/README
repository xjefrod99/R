Created a shiny app with visualizations showing the number of births in the US and mandatory sexual health education laws using ggplot.
I differentiated every state's mandatory sexual health education with a different color and added a circle on every state in which the
radius is representative of the percentage of total births in that state. Moreover, the viewer can see Racial and Ethnic Diversity of births.
The data was gathered from CDC website and shows 2017 data.
